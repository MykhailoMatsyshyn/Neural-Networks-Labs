FAISS і моделей ембеддингів Sentence Transformers. Я підготував документи, розбив їх на фрагменти, побудував векторні індекси з косинусною та L2 метриками та налаштував retriever’и для тестових запитів. Результати показали, що для нормалізованих ембеддингів обидві метрики дають однакові релевантні результати, але косинусна схожість є стандартом для NLP і краще підходить для RAG-систем.\n","\n","Потім я інтегрував retriever з LLM через OpenAI API, створив RAG-ланцюг і перевірив відповіді на запити користувача. Система успішно знаходила потрібні фрагменти та формувала стислу і змістовну відповідь із посиланням на джерела. Я зробив висновок, що обрана архітектура ефективна для роботи з документами, а параметри chunking та вибір метрики можна підбирати залежно від характеру корпусу і запитів."],"metadata":{"id":"bL83BP2cl-XU"}}]}
